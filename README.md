This is MVITA, the Multi-Cultural Virtual Interview and Training Agent!

## Inspiration
As we are in a fast, right-turning world, we need new people to work overseas and embrace new cultural perspectives to foster communication across the globe. However, many people get blocked by the cultural barriers from the first stage - the interview. We don't want that to happen. So we have created an agent to help them prepare for interviews, and really help them to learn the culture of other countries as the first step (interview).
Even if you are not applying for a job interview overseas, we believe that personalised, 1v1 individual feedback interviews shouldn't be expensive to book, especially for new graduates already suffering from financial issues. This also helps you to fit into the world culture, and teaches you how to have your name on the offer letter.

## What it does
It provides 1v1 feedback with an interview. It accepts the input of a job spec and a personal CV, and starts an interview, giving respective feedback for improvements. It will act like an agent and ask follow-up questions like a real interviewer.

## How we built it
We used Vue.js + Anam SDK as the frontend, and we used Python Flask as the backend.

## Challenges we ran into
The communication between multiple agents is the biggest challenge, because different languages are used, so it is difficult. Furthermore, we observed that the Anam Python SDK is not available yet, so we had to rewrite the frontend from Python to Vue.js.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works - the whole project is the accomplishment that we are most proud of, and it really helps us to prepare for interviews. It also looks like a tool that we would personally use to prepare for job interviews

## What we learned
We learned about how to communicate with teammates and also how to collaborate through GitHub in a very short time.  We also learned how to use the Anam SDK.

## What's next for MVITA - MindMatch
 - Improve the UI
 - Add some more functions, such as add more elaborate feedback and more templates of cultures, etc.
